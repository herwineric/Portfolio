There has been some work in the advanced R course with creating packages. To download them do the following:

library(devtools)
#1th, implementing euclidean and djikstra algorithm.
install_github("vasterlund/Lab3_Albin_Eric")

#2th, implementing a linear regression with object orientated programming.
install_github("herwineric/Lab4_Albin_Eric")

#3th, pulling data from an API and using Shiny.
install_github("herwineric/Lab5_Albin_Eric")

#4th, implementing the greedy and dynamic knapsack algorithm and a brute force knapsack algorithm with the option parallelize the computation.
install_github("herwineric/Lab6_Albin_Eric")

#5th, implementing a Ridge regression with object orientated programming.
install_github("vasterlund/Lab7_Albin_Eric")
